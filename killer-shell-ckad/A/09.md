# pod 2 deployment
In Namespace pluto there is single Pod named holy-api . It has been working okay for a while now but Team Pluto needs it to be
more reliable.
Convert the Pod into a Deployment named holy-api with 3 replicas and delete the single Pod once done. The raw Pod template file
is available at /opt/course/9/holy-api-pod.yaml .
In addition, the new Deployment should set allowPrivilegeEscalation: false and privileged: false for the security context
on container level.
Please create the Deployment and save its yaml under /opt/course/9/holy-api-deployment.yaml on ckad9043 .

```
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  privileged: false
```
