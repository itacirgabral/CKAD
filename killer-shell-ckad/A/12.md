# 12 storage
Create a new PersistentVolume named earth-project-earthflower-pv . It should have a capacity of 2Gi, accessMode
ReadWriteOnce, hostPath /Volumes/Data and no storageClassName defined.
Next create a new PersistentVolumeClaim in Namespace earth named earth-project-earthflower-pvc . It should request 2Gi
storage, accessMode ReadWriteOnce and should not define a storageClassName. The PVC should bound to the PV correctly.
Finally create a new Deployment project-earthflower in Namespace earth which mounts that volume at /tmp/project-data .
The Pods of that Deployment should be of image httpd:2.4.41-alpine .
