# 15 configMap
Team Moonpie has a nginx server Deployment called web-moon in Namespace moon . Someone started configuring it but it was
never completed. To complete please create a ConfigMap called configmap-web-moon-html containing the content of file /opt/
course/15/web-moon.html under the data key-name index.html .
The Deployment web-moon is already configured to work with this ConfigMap and serve its content. Test the nginx configuration for
example using curl from a temporary nginx:alpine Pod.

- k -n moon get pod
- k -n moon create configmap configmap-web-moon-html --from-file=index.html=/opt/course/15/web-moon.html
- k -n moon rollout restart deploy web-moon
- k -n moon get pod -o wide # get pod cluster IPs
- k run tmp --restart=Never --rm -i --image=nginx:alpine -- curl 10.44.0.78
