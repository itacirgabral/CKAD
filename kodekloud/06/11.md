For this question, please set the context to cluster3 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster3


Please use the namespace nginx-depl-svcn for the following scenario.

Create a Deployment named nginx-ckad10-svcn using the nginx image with 2 replicas.
Ensure that the Pods created by this Deployment are labeled with app=nginx-ckad.

Expose this Deployment via a ClusterIP Service named nginx-ckad10-service-svcn on port 80.
Apply the label app=nginx-ckad to the Service as well.

Create and apply a NetworkPolicy named netpol-ckad-allow-svcn that allows ingress traffic only from Pods labeled criteria=allow to the Pods labeled app=nginx-ckad.
