For this question, please set the context to cluster2 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster2



An application called results-apd is running on cluster2. In the weekly meeting, the team decides to upgrade the version of the existing image to 1.23.3 and wants to store the new version of the image in a file /root/records/new-image-records.txt on the cluster2-controlplane instance.

After upgrading the image version, to increase the availability and performance of the application, scale the deployment to 4, and ensure that the targeted pod is running.

You can SSH into the cluster2 using ssh cluster2-controlplane command.
