For this question, please set the context to cluster1 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster1



For this scenario, create an ingress controller.


We have already deployed some of the required resources (Namespaces, Service accounts, Roles and Rolebindings).

Your task is to create the Ingress controller Deployment using the manifest given at /root/nginx-controller.yaml. There are some issues in the configuration. Please find the issues and fix them.


Note: All the resources are deployed in ingress-nginx namespace.
