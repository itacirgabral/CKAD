For this question, please set the context to cluster2 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster2



A web application running on cluster2 called robox-west-apd on the fusion-apd-x1df5 namespace. The Ops team has created a new service account with a set of permissions for this web application. Update the newly created SA for this deployment.


Also, change the strategy type to Recreate, so it will delete all the pods immediately and update the newly created SA to all the pods.
