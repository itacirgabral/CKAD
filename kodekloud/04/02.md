For this question, please set the context to cluster1 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster1



In the ckad-job namespace, create a job named very-long-pi that simply computes a π (pi) to 1024 places and prints it out.

This job should be configured to retry maximum 5 times before marking this job failed, and the duration of this job should not exceed 100 seconds.

The job should use the container image perl:5.34.0.

The container should run a Perl command that calculates π (pi) to 1024 decimal places using:

perl -Mbignum=bpi -wle 'print bpi(1024)'
