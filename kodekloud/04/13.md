For this question, please set the context to cluster2 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster2



Create a Deployment named ckad13-deployment with "two replicas" of nginx image and expose it using a service named ckad13-service.


Please be noted that service needs to be accessed from both inside and outside the cluster (use port 31080).



Create the service in the default namespace.
