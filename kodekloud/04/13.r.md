Solution
The following manifest can be used to create an deployment ckad13-deployment with nginx image and 2 replicas.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ckad13-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80




To access from outside the cluster, we use nodeport type of service.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ckad13-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 31080
