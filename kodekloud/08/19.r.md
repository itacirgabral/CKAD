Set context to cluster2

use the kubectl create command we will see following error.

kubectl create -f ckad-flash89.yaml
error: resource mapping not found for name: "ckad-flash-89" namespace: "" from "ckad-flash89.yaml": no matches for kind "Pod" in version "V1"
ensure CRDs are installed first

about error shows us there is something wrong with apiVersion. So change it v1 and try again. and check status.

kubectl get pods
NAME            READY   STATUS             RESTARTS      AGE
ckad-flash89-aom   1/2     CrashLoopBackOff   3 (39s ago)   93s

Now check for reason using

kubectl describe pod ckad-flash89-aom

we will see that there is problem with nginx container

open yaml file and check in spec -> nginx container you can see error with mountPath --> mountPath: "/var/log" change it to mountPath: /var/log/nginx and apply changes.
