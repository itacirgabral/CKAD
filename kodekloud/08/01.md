For this question, please set the context to cluster1 by running:

There is a requirement to share a volume between main container and a sidecar container that are running within the same pod. Use the following instructions to create the pod and related objects:


- Create a pod named grape-pod-ckad06-str.

- The main container named nginx and should use the nginx image and mount a volume called grape-vol-ckad06-str at path /var/log/nginx.

- The sidecar container called busybox and can use busybox image.
Next, mount the same volume called grape-vol-ckad06-str at the path /usr/src.

- The volume should be of type emptyDir.
