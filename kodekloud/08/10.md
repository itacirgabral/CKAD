For this question, please set the context to cluster1 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster1



We have deployed two applications called alpha-color-app and beta-color-app on the default namespace using the kodekloud/webapp-color:v1 and kodekloud/webapp-color:v2.

We have done all the tests and do not want alpha-color-app deployment to receive traffic from the frontend-service service anymore. So, route all the traffic to another existing deployment.

Do change the service specifications to route traffic to the beta-color-app deployment.


You can test the application from the terminal by running the curl command with the following syntax: -

curl http://cluster1-controlplane:NODE-PORT
<!doctype html>
<title>Hello from Flask</title>
...
  <h2>
    Application Version: v2
  </h2>




As shown above, we will get the Application Version: v2 in the output.
