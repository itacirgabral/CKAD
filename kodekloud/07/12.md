For this question, please set the context to cluster3 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster3


We have deployed some pods in the namespaces ckad-alpha and ckad-beta.

You need to create a NetworkPolicy named ns-netpol-ckad that will restrict all Pods in Namespace ckad-alpha to only have outgoing traffic to Pods in Namespace ckad-beta . Ingress traffic should not be affected.


However, the NetworkPolicy you create should allow egress traffic on port 53 TCP and UDP.
