For this question, please set the context to cluster1 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster1



For this scenario, create a Service called ckad12-service that routes traffic to an external IP address.


Please note that service should listen on port 53 and be of type ExternalName. Use the external IP address 8.8.8.8



Create the service in the default namespace.
