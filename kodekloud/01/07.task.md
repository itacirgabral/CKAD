SECTION: APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT
For this question, please set the context to cluster2 by running:

kubectl config use-context cluster2

On the student-node, a Helm chart repository is given under the /opt/ path. It contains the files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources that can be deployed as a single unit. The files have some issues. Fix those issues and deploy them with the following specifications: -

The release name should be webapp-color-apd.
All the resources should be deployed on the frontend-apd namespace.
The service type should be node port.
Scale the deployment to 3.
Application version should be 1.20.0.
NOTE: - Remember to make necessary changes in the values.yaml and Chart.yaml files according to the specifications, and, to fix the issues, inspect the template files.
