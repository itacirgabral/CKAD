For this question, please set the context to cluster3 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster3


We have an external webserver running on student-node which is exposed at port 9999.

We have also created a service called external-webserver-ckad01-svcn that can connect to our local webserver from within the cluster3 but, at the moment, it is not working as expected.



Fix the issue so that other pods within cluster3 can use external-webserver-ckad01-svcn service to access the webserver.
