SECTION: APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT


For this question, please set the context to cluster3 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster3



On cluster3, in the dev-001 namespace, one of the interns deployed one web application called news-apd.

After successfully deploying on the worker node, we start getting alerts about the pod crashing.

We want you to inspect the dev-001 namespace and fix those issues.
