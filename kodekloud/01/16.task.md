SECTION: APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT, CONFIGURATION and SECURITY


For this question, please set the context to cluster3 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster3



We have already deployed the required pods and services in the namespace ckad01-db-sec.



Create a new secret named ckad01-db-scrt-aecs with the data given below.


Secret Name: ckad01-db-scrt-aecs

Secret 1: DB_Host=sql01

Secret 2: DB_User=root

Secret 3: DB_Password=password123

Configure ckad01-mysql-server to load environment variables from the newly created secret, where the keys from the secret should become the environment variable name in the Pod.
