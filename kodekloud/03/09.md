For this question, please set the context to cluster3 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster3



We have deployed several applications in the ns-ckad17-svcn namespace that are exposed inside the cluster via ClusterIP.


Your task is to create a LoadBalancer type service that will serve traffic to the applications based on its labels. Create the resources as follows:

Service lb1-ckad17-svcn for serving traffic at port 31890 to pods with labels "exam=ckad, criteria=location".

Service lb2-ckad17-svcn for serving traffic at port 31891 to pods with labels "exam=ckad, criteria=cpu-high".
