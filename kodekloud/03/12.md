For this question, please set the context to cluster2 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster2



We have a Kubernetes namespace called ckad12-ctm-sa-aecs, which contains a service account and a pod. Your task is to modify the pod so that it uses the service account defined in the same namespace.


Additionally, you need to ensure that the pod has access to the API credentials associated with the service account by enabling the automounting feature for the credentials.
