For this question, please set the context to cluster1 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster1



We created two ConfigMaps ( ckad02-config1-aecs and ckad02-config2-aecs ) and one Pod named ckad02-test-pod-aecs in the ckad02-mult-cm-cfg-aecs namespace.


Create two environment variables for the above pod with below specifications:


GREETINGS with the data from configmap ckad02-config1-aecs


WHO with the data from configmap ckad02-config2-aecs.


Note : Only make the necessary changes. Do not modify other fields of the pod.
