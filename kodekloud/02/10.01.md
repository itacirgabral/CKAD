For this question, please set the context to cluster3 by running:


kubectl config use-context cluster3



We have already deployed an application that consists of frontend, backend, and database pods in the app-ckad namespace. Inspect them.


Your task is to create:

A service frontend-ckad-svcn to expose the frontend pods outside the cluster on port 31100.

A service backend-ckad-svcn to make backend pods to be accessible within the cluster.

A policy database-ckad-netpol to limit access to database pods only to backend pods.
