# rollout
There is an existing Deployment named api-new-c32 in Namespace neptune . A developer did make an update to the Deployment
but the updated version never came online. Check the Deployment history and find a revision that works, then rollback to it. Could
you tell Team Neptune what the error was so it doesn't happen again?

```
k -n neptune get deploy,pod | grep api-new-c32
pod/api-new-c32-7d64747c87-zh648 0/1 ImagePullBackOff 0 141m
k -n neptune describe pod api-new-c32-7d64747c87-zh648 | grep -i error
k -n neptune describe pod api-new-c32-7d64747c87-zh648 | grep -i image
```

- k -n neptune rollout undo deploy api-new-c32
