# 07 

The board of Team Neptune decided to take over control of one e-commerce webserver from Team Saturn. The administrator who
once setup this webserver is not part of the organisation any longer. All information you could get was that the e-commerce
system is called my-happy-shop .
Search for the correct Pod in Namespace saturn and move it to Namespace neptune . It doesn't matter if you shut it down and spin
it up again, it probably hasn't any customers anyways.

- k -n saturn describe pod
- webserver-sat-003
- k -n saturn get pod webserver-sat-003 -o yaml > 7_webserver-sat-003.yaml
- k -n saturn delete pod webserver-sat-003 --force --grace-period=0
