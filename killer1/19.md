# 19 clusterIp -> nodePort
In Namespace jupiter you'll find an apache Deployment (with one replica) named jupiter-crew-deploy and a ClusterIP Service
called jupiter-crew-svc which exposes it. Change this service to a NodePort one to make it available on all nodes on port 30100.
Test the NodePort Service using the internal IP of all available nodes and the port 30100 using curl , you can reach the internal
node IPs directly from your main terminal. On which nodes is the Service reachable? On which node is the Pod running?
