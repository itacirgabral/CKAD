# labels
Team Sunny needs to identify some of their Pods in namespace sun . They ask you to add a new label protected: true to all Pods
with an existing label type: worker or type: runner . Also add an annotation protected: do not delete this pod to all Pods
having the new label protected: true .

- k -n sun get pod --show-labels
- k -n sun label pod -l type=runner protected=true # run for label runner
- k -n sun label pod -l type=worker protected=true # run for label worker
- k -n sun annotate pod -l protected=true protected="do not delete this pod"
