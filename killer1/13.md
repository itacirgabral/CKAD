# PVC que aumenta
Team Moonpie, which has the Namespace moon , needs more storage. Create a new PersistentVolumeClaim named moon-pvc-126 in
that namespace. This claim should use a new StorageClass moon-retain with the provisioner set to moon-retainer and the
reclaimPolicy set to Retain. The claim should request storage of 3Gi, an accessMode of ReadWriteOnce and should use the new
StorageClass.
The provisioner moon-retainer will be created by another team, so it's expected that the PVC will not boot yet. Confirm this by
writing the event message from the PVC into file /opt/course/13/pvc-126-reason on ckad9043 .

correctly registered.
